Interactive filters available in the dashboard:

*Department:* Narrow down data to focus on individual clinical units for performance review.

*Admission Type:* Enables analysis based on how patients entered the system.

*Date Range:* Supports time-based comparisons for trend analysis.

**Key Findings:**
