**Title:** Pizza sales analysis project

**SQL Code:**
[Pizza Data] (https://github.com/Vick5788/gitihub.io/blob/main/Pizza.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:**
Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information such as pizza names, order details, and dates from the sales dataset.

Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated total revenue, total pizzas sold, and the number of unique orders to understand sales performance.

Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied conditional filters to analyze pizza sales by category, date ranges, size, and price thresholds.

Data Source Specification (FROM): Used the pizza_sales table as the primary data source for all analyses.

**Project Description:**
This project focuses on the analysis of a detailed pizza sales dataset to derive business insights using SQL. The primary objective is to extract and summarize key performance indicators such as revenue, order volume, and popular pizza choices.

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Ensure consistency and integrity of the dataset, enabling accurate SQL analysis.

Data Analysis Using SQL: Execute structured queries to analyze different aspects of the business including:

Sales trends (e.g., revenue by month, pizza sizes sold)

Customer preferences (e.g., top-selling pizzas, category-specific performance)

Time-based insights (e.g., sales in specific months or seasons)

Insight Extraction: Discover patterns in pizza sales such as high-performing items, underperforming categories, and seasonal buying behavior.

Reporting: Generate query results that can be visualized in dashboards or reports for stakeholders to support data-driven decisions in marketing and inventory planning.

By the end of the project, the dataset provides a reliable foundation for understanding business performance, helping stakeholders make informed operational and strategic choices.
